# Since Xcode 8 beta 4, calling `PBXProject.projectWithFile` breaks subsequent calls to
# `chdir`. While sounding ridiculous, this is unfortunately true and debugging it from the
# userland side showed no difference at all to successful calls to `chdir`, but the working
# directory is simply not changed in the end. This workaround is even more absurd, monkey
# patching all calls to `chdir` to use `__pthread_chdir` which appears to work.
